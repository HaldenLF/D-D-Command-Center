## Dungeons and Dragons Command Center System

--- Note that some files got corrupted and need to be added once fixed. Will add at a later date ---

This system was designed for a D&D game with friends. 
It has riddles and clues about why the machine arrived in the city.
There is also some traps as well so they need to be careful in order to not blow up.
